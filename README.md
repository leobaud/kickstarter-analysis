Hello Louise, 									
									
Based on the graphic above, the months of May and June, tend to be the best period of the year when a campaign can be started and be successful. During the month of October is when the success of a campaign is uncertain. If you look at the trends, the success and failure of a campaign are really close to be the same, hence with this level of uncertainty, it would not be recommended to start a campaign in October. Yet a much deeper analysis could help to lower this uncertainty as we might understand which factors affect the campaigns during October. By a simple analysis it is recommended to begin your theater campaign on the months of May or June. The chances of success with the data analyzed also suggest the lower your goal, the more chance of success as well.

Hello Louise, 								
								
Based on the information presented in this analysis, it is save to say that the less the goal of you theater campaign the more chances of success it has. By looking at the graphic, you could think that campaigns with goals between $35000.00 and $39999.00 are successful too, yet the volume of campaigns in comparisson with the lower goals campaigns is really significant. In order to determine the success of this high goals campaigns, we would need to do a more deep analysis based on more variables like, country, backers and most importantly subcategory of the campaing. By looking at the complete data base, some of these campaings are for Theater space, meaning, building a theater hence the goal needs to be high.
